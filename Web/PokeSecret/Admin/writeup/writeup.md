In this challenge, we observe that we can modify the Pokemon characters. When we visit the secret endpoint, it displays "You are not Pikachu." Upon inspecting the cookie, we notice that it is set to the corresponding Pokémon name.

Changing the Pokémon name to Pikachu will provide us with the flag.
