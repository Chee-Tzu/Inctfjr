### Difficulty
easy

### Challenge Description

Pikachu and his friends embark on a quest to find the flag. They have some clues about the location. Can you assist them in finding the flag?

### Short Writeup

In this challenge, a set of places is given. If we go to inspect element, it gives a hint: "It looks like the search bar is accepting commands." From this, we can understand that it takes Linux commands.

Using ls, cat, and head won't work as they are blacklisted. Using tac flag.txt gives us the flag.

### Flag
