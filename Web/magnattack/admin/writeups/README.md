To bypass the game and reveal the flag in Magnattack:

    Send a POST request to /score with a high score value (e.g., 101) using tools like curl or the browser console.

    Access /s3cr3t to view the flag bi0s{magn3t0n_15_5t33l} once the score exceeds 100.

    This method circumvents gameplay by directly manipulating the score endpoint.
