# Cube at His Prime

### Challenge Description

Given that Ceaser Cipher is relatively easy to decipher, I've developed a new cipher that significantly surpasses the Caesar Cipher in terms of security. Are you up for the challenge of cracking it?

**Challenge File**:
+ [chall.py](./handout/Cube_at_His_Prime/src/chall.py)

**MD5 Hash**: 

### Short Writeup

+ When we expand both the equations and then subtract b from a.
+ We get `a - b = 6 * n * p`. From here we can easily find the value of p.
