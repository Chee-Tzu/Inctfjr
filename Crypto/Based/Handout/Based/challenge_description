# Challenge Description

# As you traverse the depths of the second layer of the underworld, you encounter large metallic fragments resembling humanoid bodies, much like your own. 
# A scan of one such body reveals remnants of data still intact. Amidst a hoard of corrupted information, you uncover fragments of their attempts to escape the underworld.
# Yet, it seems that their efforts were abruptly cut short... 
# You discover Ciphertexts that seem to be written in a different number system than the one you are familiar with, can you decrypt the message?
